Purpose
-------

The traditional way to find new content usually consists of doing 
a single regular search, manually traversing the returned search 
results, finding something you want, queueing it for download, 
waiting for it to complete and then enjoying the newly fetched content.

This is all fine and dandy for those spontaneous searches.

And every time you want to check for new content you will 
have to redo your search.

But what if you don't want to spend time redoing your searches?
What if you could subscribe on searches?

This is where Autoqueue comes in.

What it does
------------

Autoqueue communicates directly with your download application, 
like you do, but automatically.

It carries out user defined searches repeatedly on scheduled 
and randomized basis, analyzes search results, compares with 
previous downloads and criterias, queues matching content for 
download, waits for them to complete and then moves them to 
selected locations. You can even get a mail when new files 
has arrived.

Benefits
--------

* Do searches on times while you're away from the host to 
  reach sources on other time zones that usually are offline
  when you are online and vice versa

* Subscribe on content by repeating the searches

* Get files sorted after they have completed

* Get mail reports about fetched files

* Get preview images of content being downloaded

* Does not queue already downloaded content

How it works
------------

The service is executed by a cronjob.

This service (and the GUI to manage it) communicates with your 
download application through the HTTP interface supplied by 
your download application.
